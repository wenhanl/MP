The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as 
part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern 
application in the ROT13 system. As with all single alphabet substitution ciphers, 
the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no 
communication security.
